Exploring the world of Data Science.<br>
It is a repo for Data Science and Data Analysis, to daily practice and research.

## Description:
Data science is the domain of study that deals with vast volumes of data using modern tools and techniques to find unseen patterns, derive meaningful information, and make business decisions. Data science uses complex machine learning algorithms to build predictive models.


### Things to do:

#### 1. Data Analysis
Data analysis is the practice of working with data to glean useful information, which can then be used to make informed decisions.

#### 2. Machine Learning
Machine learning is the backbone of data science. Data Scientists need to have a solid grasp of ML in addition to basic knowledge of statistics.

#### 3. Modeling
Mathematical models enable you to make quick calculations and predictions based on what you already know about the data. Modeling is also a part of Machine Learning and involves identifying which algorithm is the most suitable to solve a given problem and how to train these models.

#### 4. Statistics
Statistics are at the core of data science. A sturdy handle on statistics can help you extract more intelligence and obtain more meaningful results.

#### 5. Programming
Some level of programming is required to execute a successful data science project. The most common programming languages are Python, and R. Python is especially popular because itâ€™s easy to learn, and it supports multiple libraries for data science and ML.

#### 6. Databases
A capable data scientist needs to understand how databases work, how to manage them, and how to extract data from them.
